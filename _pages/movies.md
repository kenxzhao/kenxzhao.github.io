The following animations below encapsulate many of the key science questions that motivate my research.

### Simulations of Greenland's Glacial Fjords

![GRL paper](/assets/images/greenlandwidevort.mp4)

Near surface (z=-150 m) vorticity in deep warm-water glacial fjords around Greenland.

### Idealized Submesoscale-resolving Fjord Simulations

![GRL paper](/assets/images/refv7hiv8vort.mov)

Vorticity in an idealized bathtub-like glacial fjord at various depths at unprecedented (16 m horizontal, 5 m vertical) resolution.

### Standing Eddies within Fjords

![GRL paper](/assets/images/jakob3_newplume3dvort_inst.mov)

3D surfaces of vorticity with realistic Ilulissat Icefjord geometry showing the emergence and evolution of standing eddies. The fjord circulation is driven by meltwater and discharge plume parameterization at the eastern boundary glacial face.
