I am a physical oceanographer who uses theory, numerics, and observations to understand geophysical flows in the ocean. My current focus is on how ocean circulation drives glacial melt in places where ice and ocean meet (e.g., fjords, ice shelf cavities, sea ice). More broadly, I am interested by geophysical fluid dynamics and turbulence.

I’m currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the Straneo Lab and a Research Associate at Oregon State University. I recently completed an NSF OPP postdoctoral fellowship at Oregon State University and I received my PhD in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Department at UCLA funded by a NASA FINESST fellowship.
