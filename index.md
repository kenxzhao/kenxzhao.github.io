I am a physical oceanographer who uses theory, numerics, and observations to understand geophysical flows in the ocean. My current focus is on how ocean circulation drives glacial melt in places where ice and ocean meet (e.g., fjords, ice shelf cavities, sea ice). More broadly, I am interested by geophysical fluid dynamics and turbulence.

I’m currently an NSF OPP postdoctoral fellow at Oregon State University as of January, 2022. I received my PhD in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Department at UCLA funded by an NASA FINESST fellowship.
