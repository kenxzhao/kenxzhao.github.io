I am a physical oceanographer who uses theory and numerics to understand geophysical flows in the ocean. My current focus is polar ocean dynamics - in particular how ocean circulation drive glacial melt in places where ice and ocean meet (e.g., fjords, ice shelf cavities, sea ice). More broadly, I am interested by geophysical fluid dynamics and turbulence.

I was a NASA FINESST scholar and PhD candidate in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) Department at UCLA.
I'm currently working as a NSF OPP postdoctoral fellow at researcher at Oregon State University as of January, 2022.
